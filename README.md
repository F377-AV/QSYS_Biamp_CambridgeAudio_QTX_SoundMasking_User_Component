------ About ------

This is a custom user module I created to send commands to a BiAmp Cambridge Audio Sound Masking System from a QSYS system using HTTP GET Commands.

This is Rev1 of this module. In the future i will be adding feedback and additional features.

MAKE SURE TO LEAVE CREDIT INSIDE THE CODE.

THIS IS NOT FOR RESALE.
